## üëÄ About VideoHallu

With the recent success of video generation models such as [Sora](https://openai.com/sora/), [Veo2](https://veo2.ai), [Kling](https://www.klingai.com/global/), the visual quality of generated videos has reached new heights‚Äîmaking evaluation more challenging and pushing it beyond traditional metrics like frame consistency, resolution, and realism. However, we find that MLLMs struggle to detect abnormalities in generated videos, which is crucial for developing reliable automatic video evaluation methods.

We introduce VideoHallu, a curated dataset that includes videos generated by seven video generation models and a question-answer set to test MLLM's abilities to catch generated videos' abnormalities.

We also use GRPO to train [Qwen-2.5-VL-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) on a subset of our dataset and show improvement on generated video understanding.


## üî• News
- [2025/05/2] We release our datasets in huggingfaceü§ó.

## üîç Dataset

To facilitate GRPO training, we also randomly sample 1,000 videos from [PhysBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WeiChow/PhysBench-train) training data to first improve model' reasoning abilities in real-world videos, then train the model on part of our synthetic videos.

Our data spans the following categories:

<h4>ü§ñ Model Response (Video-R1-7B):</h4>

<div style="background-color:#fefefe; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 10px 16px;">
Let me think step-by-step. The bookshelf is on the left side of the room. The bathroom is on the right side.<br>
So I should turn <strong>right</strong> to head toward it.<br>
Then go forward to reach the bathroom door.<br>
At the door, I turn <strong>left</strong> to face the sink.<br><br>
‚úÖ <strong>Final Answer: C. Turn Right, Turn Left</strong>

## üß† Aha Moment in Video Reasoning

One of the most intriguing outcomes of reinforcement learning in Video-R1 is the emergence of self-reflection reasoning behaviors, commonly referred to as ‚Äúaha moments‚Äù. Some examples are as follows.

## üìà RL Training Curves

The accuracy reward exhibits a generally upward trend, indicating that the model continuously improves its ability to produce correct answers under RL.

Interestingly, the response length curve first drops at the beginning of RL training, then gradually increases. We guess this is because the model initially discards its previous, potentially sub-optimal reasoning style. Then gradually converges to a better and stable reasoning policy.

## üìê Set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tulerfeng/Video-R1
cd Video-R1

# build environment
conda create -n video-r1 python=3.11 
conda activate video-r1
bash setup.sh

# qwen video extraction setting, e.g., max frames, resolutions
# Use the [decord] feature to improve speed
cd src/qwen-vl-utils
pip install -e .[decord]
cd ..

# download training dataset
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/Video-R1/Video-R1-data
```

Please put the downloaded dataset to `src/r1-v/Video-R1-data/`

Then, unzip the data

```
python ./src/unzip.py
```

The `Video-R1-260k.json` file is for RL training while `Video-R1-COT-165k.json` is for SFT cold start.

Qwen2.5-VL has been frequently updated in the Transformers library, which may cause version-related bugs or inconsistencies. Our code is compatible with the following version, please download at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kc81WZitEhUZYWXpL6y2GXuSXufLSYcF/view?usp=sharing)

Then install our provided version of transformers

```bash
unzip transformers-main.zip
cd ./transformers-main
pip install .
```

For vLLM library, please use 0.7.2 version.

For trl library, please use 0.16.0 version.

## üöÄ Training

We first perform supervised fine-tuning on the Video-R1-COT-165k dataset for one epoch to obtain the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-SFT model. If you want to perform CoT annotation on your own data, please refer to `src/generate_cot_vllm.py`

```bash
bash ./src/scripts/run_sft_video.sh
```
If you want to skip the SFT process, we also provide one of our SFT models at [ü§óQwen2.5-VL-SFT](https://huggingface.co/Video-R1/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-COT-SFT). 

This is followed by RL training on the Video-R1-260k dataset to produce the final Video-R1 model. Due to current computational resource limitations, we train the model for only 1.2k RL steps.  

The script for training the obtained Qwen2.5-VL-7B-SFT model with T-GRPO or GRPO is as follows

```bash
bash ./src/scripts/run_grpo_video.sh
```

You can also use the following script to enable vLLM acceleration for RL training

```bash
bash ./src/scripts/run_grpo_vllm_qwen25vl.sh
```

For efficiency considerations, we limit the maximum number of video frames to 16 during training. Each frame is processed at a max resolution of 128 √ó 28 √ó 28.  You can set this in `src/qwen-vl-utils`

Please keep per_device_train_batch_size=1 as in previous work r1-v

## üîÆ Inference & Evaluation

During inference, we increase the max frame resolution to 256 √ó 28 √ó 28 and max frames to 16/32/64 to enhance performance. You can easily set this in `src/qwen-vl-utils`

For all evaluations, we follow the decoding configuration used in the official Qwen2.5-VL demo, with top\_p = 0.001 and temperature = 0.01. Setting large top_p may encounter messy output when inference.

We recommend using our provided json files and scripts for easier evaluation. 

The json files can be downloaded at: [[ü§ó Video-R1-eval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Video-R1/Video-R1-eval)], put them in `/src/r1-v/Evaluation` 

Next, download the evaluation video data from each benchmark‚Äôs official website, and place them in `/src/r1-v/Evaluation` as specified in the provided json files.

Finally, conduct evaluation on all benchmarks using the following scripts

```bash
bash ./src/eval_bench.sh
```
